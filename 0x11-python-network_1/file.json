This occured because the relevant railties would add the item to `config.active_record.query_log_tags` again during setup. This PR fixes that by only adding those items to the config if they aren't already set.\n\nThe issue proposed more documentation to work around this, but I think it's a bug and should be fixed

keyword argument in `check_box_tag` and `radio_button_tag`\n\nCurrently if you do this:\n\n```ruby\ncheck_box_tag \"admin\", \"1\", checked: false\n```\n\nIt is treated [as truthy](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/19f9922523f723a3843f1d6f42327731cf787b13/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/form_tag_helper.rb#L444), and your checkbox is checked. This can be a bit surprising, particularly because the `FormHelper` version [does support](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/19f9922523f723a3843f1d6f42327731cf787b13/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/form_helper.rb#L1285) a keyword argument.\n\n```ruby\nf.check_box \"admin\", checked: false\n```\n\nSo this PR updates `check_box_tag` and `radio_button_tag` to support `checked` as a positional or keyword argument, this way you can use the same API in both cases.\n\nCo-authored-by: Jonathan Hefner

If an attribute was\nnot updated, and therefore `value_for_database` was not previously\ncomputed, this will involve an unnecessary serialize (and cast,\ndepending on type).  And if the attribute was not previously read, it\nwill also involve an unnecessary deserialize (and cast, depending on\ntype).\n\nThis commit overrides `FromDatabase#forgetting_assignment` to dup the\nattribute instead of computing `value_for_database` in the case where\nthe attribute was not updated.
